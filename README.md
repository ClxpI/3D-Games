# 3D_EndlessRunner

This is a Unity 3D Endless Runner game built using **C#**. The game showcases how to implement essential game mechanics, including player movement, obstacle spawning, and score tracking, all in a 3D environment.

## What I Learned

- **Programming Skills**:
  - Gained hands-on experience with Unity's scripting in C#.
  - Learned to handle **player movement** using Unity's physics and input system.
  - Implemented **obstacle spawning** at random intervals to create an endless challenge for the player.
  - Managed **score tracking** and displayed it in the game UI using Unity’s UI system.
- **Creating Assets and Materials**: Learned to create 3D assets in Unity, including materials, textures, and lighting to improve the game’s appearance and feel.
- **Gameplay Design**: Designed an engaging and challenging gameplay loop with obstacles and player progression.

## How to Access the Game Code

To explore the game's code, navigate to the `Assets` folder. Here are some key scripts to check out:

- **CameraFollow.cs**: Handles the camera's movement and follows the player character as they run.
- **ObstacleSpawner.cs**: Spawns obstacles at random positions, creating a dynamic gameplay experience.
- **PlayerMovement.cs**: Controls the player’s movement mechanics.
- **ScoreManager.cs**: Tracks and displays the player’s score as they progress in the game.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to enhance the game by adding exciting new features:

- **In-Game Currency**: Introduce a currency system that rewards players for running a longer distance.
- **Shop for Skins**: Allow players to use the currency to purchase character skins.
- **Improved Obstacles and Power-ups**: Add variety to obstacles and introduce power-ups for the player to collect.
- **Better Graphics**: Enhance the game visuals with new assets, textures, and lighting effects.
